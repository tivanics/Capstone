# Capstone
This application was made as a capstone project for the Data Science for Public Health class at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
Multistate model shiny app for hepatocellular carcinoma oncologic outcome modeling

The application is built with the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) framework for the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). The charts use [Plotly](http://plot.ly).
